# AXIT

## 🚀 Project Description
**AXIT** is a modern, responsive one-page prototype template built with React and SCSS—perfect for showcasing beautiful designs and interactive UI patterns. It lets you:

- Showcase a full-screen hero header with background imagery and a signup form   
- Highlight key features with custom iconography and concise copy  
- Display pricing options side-by-side in a clean card layout  
- Collect customer feedback via a testimonial slider  
- Include a “Contact Us” form section for lead capture  
- Offer footer social links and a dropdown menu for mobile navigation  

Built to demonstrate best practices in component-driven UI development, AXIT is a great starting point for landing-page prototypes or production sites.
